Spring Boot runs on default port 8080 (same as keycloak, hence we will need to change one of them in the future)
Port can be changed in the application.properties file (server.port = 8081)

IamStudyApplication.java
- @SpringBootApplication
    - Scans the projects, starts the server (port 8080 by default)
    - Loads all controllers (HelloController in my case)
    - Connects to PostgreSQL
- main - launches Sprint Boot's the built-in server aka Tomcat

HelloController.java
- Loads endpoints
- @RestController
    - Exposes HTTP endpoints
- @GetMapping("/hello")
    - Provides the stuff to do when someone runs the endpoint "/hello" (In our case, it will show a string saying "Hello IAM!")
- This whole code basically makes sure that our backend responds to http://localhost:8080/hello

application.properties
- First 3 lines with env variables to help Spring Boot connect to our database
- spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
    - Will automatically create/update tables
- spring.jpa.show-sql=true
    - Helps you know which SQLs Spring Boot has executed
    - This is NOT a recommended practice for production due to security concerns + too much logging
    - Only use in DEV and for debugging incase an SQL fails or a table is missing, etc...

Entity Basics
-   @Entity
    public class UserEntity {
        @Id @GeneratedValue
        private Long id;
        private String name;
    }
Meaning:
    - @Entity = becomes a database table
    - Fields = table columns
    - @Id = primary key
Entities basics required later for roles, permissions, and audit data, as they come from DB.

1. Spring Boot by default starts at http protocol and NOT https
2. Using https will throw an error "Invalid character found in method name" as it was expecting http
3. Steps to start the application:
    (i). Run your Spring Boot application first and check for the below lines to make sure it started correctly:
        a. Tomcat started on port(s): 8080
        b. Started IamStudyApplication
    (ii). Then open the url
